  <title>Language Plugins</title>

  <para>Language plugins are the core concept behind the flexibility of
  &jlexis; to enable studying a particular foreign language with &jlexis; as a
  language-independent program. These plugins add all the specifics which make
  each language unique to the vocabulary trainer. While the &jlexis; main
  program can manage vocabulary data at the most general level, a language
  plugin gives &jlexis; all hints and functions necessary for working with one
  particular foreign language.</para>
